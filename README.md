# PasteBinCopy

> A Ruby on Rails project

This project is a copy of the website [Pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/) with a fully functioning guest or user posting action. Signing up unlocks new features in the CRUD process: users have the ability to edit or delete their posts as well as display all their posts in a single, private page.

Guests can add posts that can be shared via URLs and are displayed on a "Public Pastes" page.

## Build Setup
